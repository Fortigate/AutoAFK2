# AutoAFK2

## An automation tool for AFK Journey

Same as the last project except this time much much lighter.

Currently supports two modes:

````autoafk2.exe --teamup````

Will open chat and join any active Corrupt Creature as a priority, if none are found it will send your second strongest hero to any Synergy battle Requests. Great for farming hearts for affinity items overnight, and helps your server out!

````autoafk2.exe --dailies````

Will run these tasks to complete your daily quests:

* Claim AFK Rewards (twice for Noble Path quest)
* Collect Friendship Points
* Collect Mail
* Purchase a 210 gem summon card from the Guild Store in the Emporium
* Battle Arena
* Battle Dream Realm and collect rewards
* Collect all:
  * Daily Quests
  * Guild Quests
  * Growth quests
  * Noble Path
  * Events (some of them anyway)
* Click all heroes for 6 affinity a day
  

More functionality and features coming as as when I have energy to add them.

## How to use

Get the latest [release](https://github.com/Fortigate/AutoAFK2/releases), specify your ADB port in settings.ini and run with appropriate launch parameter
