# AutoAFK2

## An automation tool for AFK Journey

Same as the last project except this time much much lighter.

Currently supports two modes:

````autoafk2.exe --teamup````

Will open chat and join any active Corrupt Creature as a priority, if none are found it will send your second strongest hero to any Synergy battle Requests. Great for farming hearts for affinity items overnight, and helps your server out!

````autoafk2.exe --dailies````

Will run these tasks to complete your daily quests:

* Claim AFK Rewards
* Collect Friendship Points
* Collect Mail
* Purchase a 210 gem summon card from the Guild Store in the Emporium
* Battle Arena once
* Collect all:
  * Daily Quests
  * Guild Quests
  * Growth quests
  

More functionality and features coming as as when I have energy to add them.
